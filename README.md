# Kaggle X Skill Assessment Challenge 2024

## Overview:
This notebooks details the models and techniques I used for the Kaggle X challenge that spanned may 10th to june 24th 2024. The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model fine-tuned on the Used Car Price Prediction Dataset dataset also on Kaggle, the results of all the models were exported and submitted to the challenge with the highest scores achieved by the LGB and XGB models were 76379 and 76431 RMSE on the public leaderboard respectively. On the private leaderboard, the final score achieved was 70192 which ranks 567th out of the final 1850 entries.

## Project Workflow:

**1. Data Collection and Overview:**
   - Imported the dataset and libraries needed.
   - Conducted initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

**2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, outliers, and converted categorical variables.
   - Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis and modeling.
   - Identified important features for prediction.
   - Created new features or modified existing ones to enhance model prediction.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized and analyzed dataset characteristics.
   - Explored relationships between variables to identify patterns and trends.

**4. Model Selection and Training:**
   - Selected machine learning models for prediction
   - Split the data into training and testing sets and trained various models.
   - Evaluated model performance using RMSE

**5. Conclusion and Results:**
   - Using all of the trained models on the test dataset.
   - Exporting the predicitions for each model
